## How to build from source

First make sure you have these libraries installed:
* [Sketch](https://github.com/vydd/sketch)
* [Harmony](https://github.com/Shirakumo/harmony)

Then load and run `build-game.lisp` in [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/).

This should create a new executable called `hectors-maze`.

Now the game is built! Open the finished executable to play the game.
